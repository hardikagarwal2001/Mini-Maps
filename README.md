# Mini-Maps

Using Google Maps to travel around has become a very handy method and finding the shortest route to go from one place to another has undoubtedly reduced the travel time by a significant amount. Almost everyone now relies on such methods whenever they travel to any new place or just want to plan out their schedule by figuring out the estimated time it will take for them to reach their destination.

This project will help the user to find the shortest path and estimated time amount (ETA) to from one destination to another. It tells the user the cities and states he should go through in order to reach its destination. The user can also ask for the next best alternate route in case they donâ€™t want to take the route that takes the least amount of time.
